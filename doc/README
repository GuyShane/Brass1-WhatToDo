This is a simple to do list application, where the user can add items,
check off completed items, and archive them.
The app also allows the user to delete and email items.

There are tabs to allow the user to switch between viewing current
to do items and archived items.
At the top of each of those views there are summaries of relevant
information.
The user can click on an item's checkbox to mark it as done or 
not done in the to do view.
To perform other actions, the user can click on an item to highlight it,
and any others as well, and then use the buttons at the bottom of
the screen to either delete, archive, or email the selected items.
In the action bar are options to add an item, or to email the entire
list.

The two main helper classes I made are ToDoItem and FileHandler.

ToDoItem is a data class, used to store items to be displayed.
It stores the item's text, and whether or not it is checked.

FileHandler deals with writing to and reading from a local file
for data persistence.
